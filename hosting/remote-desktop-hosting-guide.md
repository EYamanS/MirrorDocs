# Remote Desktop Hosting Guide

Please refer to the previous chapter: "Pragmatic Hosting Guide" for a proper, best practices guide on how to host multiplayer games.

This guide is about my custom method to host long running servers with a remote desktop, without worrying about SSH, SCP, terminals, etc.

{% hint style="info" %}
This is not very resource effective, and definitely not best practice.\
It is however very convenient.
