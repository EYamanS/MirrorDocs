# EdgegapLobby



This is a copy of the [Tanks](tanks.md) example (basic scene with player controlled tanks), but with a lobby ui for using Edgegap's Lobby and Relay service.

It showcases how one might interact with the [EdgegapLobbyKcpTransport](../transports/edgegap-relay-transport.md#edgegaplobbykcptransport) to list, join and create lobbies, providing a good starting point for anyone wanting to use Edgegap lobbies.
