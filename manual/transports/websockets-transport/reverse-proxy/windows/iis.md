# IIS

Once you have your Windows Web Server up and running and RDP access to it, you'll probably need to install a couple optional modules:

* URL Rewrite Module - Download [here](https://iis-umbraco-dr.azurewebsites.net/downloads/microsoft/url-rewrite) and install it.
* Application Request Routing (ARR) - download [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=47333) and install it.

From the Start menu, type IIS and you'll be able to select Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager.

In IIS Manager, select the server just below Start Page in the left panel, and open Configuration Editor in the Management section near the bottom of the main window.

<div align="left">

</div>

Change the Section selector to `system.webServer/proxy` as shown in this image and set Enabled to True and click Apply (top right).

### Initial Site Bindings

Now in the left panel of IIS Manager, expand the server and Sites and select the Default Web Site.

* In the right panel, click Bindings.
* In the Bindings window, double-click the single entry that will be there for port 80.
* In the Host name field, type the Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) that you want clients to connect to, and click OK, and then Close the Site Bindings window.
* This will be your domain that you've registered and set up DNS pointing to this web server.

<div align="left">

<figure><img src="../../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (21).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Edit Site Bindings - Type your FQDN and click OK</p></figcaption></figure>

</div>

This is what it should look like when you're done:

</div>

### App Pool Recycling

Since all clients will be connected through IIS, which uses a "worker process" that will self-recycle by default at a time interval, we need to disable recycling because that would disconnect all clients.

* With the Default Web Site still selected, click Basic Settings in the right panel, and make note of the name of the Application Pool name shown in that window, then close that window.
* In the left panel, click Application Pools and in the main panel select the one that was assigned in Basic Settings above, and click Recycling in the right panel.
* In the Edit Application Pool Recycling Settings, make sure nothing is checked (as shown below), then click Next, and then Finish.

### SSL Certificate

{% hint style="warning" %}
NOTE: DNS records pointing to this server need to be done before this step, and propagated to the world DNS servers.  If you can't reach this site with a browser, setting up SSL using WinAcme won't work.
{% endhint %}

You'll need an SSL certificate for your domain.

* Download WinAcme and save it to its own folder from [here](https://www.win-acme.com/) and unzip it to that same folder (makes updating it convenient later as you can safely overwrite with newer versions).
* Run WACS.exe and follow the prompts to create a Certificate using default settings for the Default site in IIS. You'll update the bindings after this step for the game client and proxy.
* WinAcme creates a scheduled task to update the SSL periodically before it expires.

</div>

### Additional Site Bindings

After successfully installing the SSL with WinAcme, return to IIS Manager, select the Default site, and click Bindings again as you did before.

You'll see that WinAcme has added a binding for port 443 with the same host name you used for port 80.

You can double click the port 443 binding to see how it is set up with the SSL certificate selected.

Click Add to create one more binding for port 7777 as shown below, using the same SSL certificate as was used for port 443.  This will be for the client to connect to the Reverse Proxy that will be set up later in this document. If you're running multiple game server instances on the same server, just add a binding for each port you're using. Make sure your firewall has all of the ports open.

### WebGL Server

Deploy your server build to a folder under `c:\` and start it on port `27777`. Make sure you set that correctly in Simple Web Transport when building the server or add code to your Network Manager to force that when running headless mode.

### WebGL Client

Make sure Simple Web Transport is set up like this:

* Port `7777`
* Client Use Wss checked
* Ssl Enabled **not** checked
* Ssl Protocols set to Tls 12.

</div>

### web.config for IIS

In IIS Manager, right-click the Default site that you configured earlier and choose Explore. This is the folder where you'll deploy your WebGL build files.&#x20;

* If there's already a `web.config` file in that folder, open it in Notepad, otherwise create an empty one and open it.
* Merge the XML below into whatever might already be there, save and close it.
* Go back to IIS, select the server itself, and click Restart in the right panel.

The web.config file below assumes several things:

* You've built your server to listen on port `27777` and the WebGL client to connect to `7777`.
* You've built your WebGL client using brotli (preferred) or gzip compression.
* You've set up the bindings as shown above.
* If you made bindings for more servers, you'll need to add additional Reverse Proxy rules to the rules section below, by copy/paste and changing the port in the pattern and action.
